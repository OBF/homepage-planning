Kind of an outline for how the fellowships section could be done. Sorry about the cropped images, making a full page made all the text look smaller. I hope it is alright, if not I'll upload the full image as it is :) I didn't include the menu bar and footer for this as it would be the same for every section, till we get to the BOSC sub-site. That should probably have a separate menu. 

Desktop version: 

-- I feel using larger font sizes for the important points would make them stand out more and help the reader focus more on them, so tried it! Little blurbs might make it easy to find what the reader is looking for?

-- The blue blurb in the selection criteria is supposed to remain constant while we're scrolling in that section.

-- Please let me know if I should change some alignments or colors and the like!
