-- An idea is to keep the homepage as a long page wherein we can easily see an overview of what OBS is all about. I can make a quick links tab as well maybe at the top so that the members can get to the links they care about more, i.e, the projects list, membership details, events, volunteering for BOSC, etc, while still keeping the site friendly for people who aren't members yet.

-- We could keep the BOSC and GSoC links as a scroll image right at the start, for easy access. I've only added a placeholder image for BOSC as of now. As in, the image switches between the BOSC link and GSoc link. Maybe we could add some other links for that as well, showcasing the main activities. For the events tab as well as the blog posts, there should be a next button to quickly move to the next latest event/post, just for easy access and to get a general idea without having to move further down.

-- Most of the panels will have a link to another page which would have more details about it, like the travel fellowships panel would link to a more detailed version of it.

-- We can try to make it more newcomer friendly by moving the chat + mailing list joining links further up the document. But I figured that since we're making it mostly for the members so it should be okay if we have this at the bottom.

-- The orange color scheme is just a color I picked that seemed to look good, so it isn't a problem to mess around with the color schemes! Adding animations would be pretty cool too, but I haven't attempted it for the page yet. It would be great to have some!

-- There's still a few things I have missed here, like adding a quick join/login button and all. It'll be easier once we try it in Wordpress.
