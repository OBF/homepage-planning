# OBF Homepage
Repository for the re-design of the OBF homepage. 

My home page design(coded): https://kushinauwu.github.io/Theme-2/
This code focuses more on only a few elements. I have used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JS for this. The images used are free to use placeholders and have no relevance. They are to be replaced by I will be finishing the code and converting it into a Wordpress theme if I am selected as an intern. The page can be made mobile friendly by using Wordpress plugins. I can also code it accordingly if need be.

Mockup of this design: https://github.com/kushinauwu/Theme-2/blob/master/OBF%20theme%202.pdf
This is a sample of how the website would look like.
